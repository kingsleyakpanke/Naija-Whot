  <h1>Whot tactics — intermediate tips</h1>
  <p>This guide gives practical tips for players who know the basics and want to win more often. It includes stack management, WHOT timing, and when to hold on.</p>

  <h2>Stack awareness</h2>
  <p>Keep track of pick-2 and pick-3 stacks. If a pick stack is active, decide whether you can defend with the same number; otherwise draw early and focus on discarding high-value cards.</p>

  <h2>WHOT timing</h2>
  <p>Use WHOT to force shapes that favour your hand. If you have multiple cards of a shape, switching the demand can give you multiple plays in a row.</p>

  <h2>Hold-on strategy</h2>
  <p>1 (hold-on) is powerful when combined with a strong hand; use it to chain plays and create pressure on opponents.</p>
