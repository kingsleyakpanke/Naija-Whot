  <h1>The story of Whot in Nigeria, from neighbourhoods to mobile phones</h1>
  <p><em>Whot</em> has been part of Nigerian social life for generations. Though the exact origin of the game is tangled with many regional adaptations, by the mid-20th century Whot was widely played across households, schools and street corners, a quick social game needing only a small deck and a handful of friends.</p>

  <h2>How it travelled to Nigeria</h2>
  <p>Whot shares ancestry with early non-standard card decks and commercial “call” cards introduced in the 20th century. Its simplicity and versatility made it easy to adopt and adapt; local communities created house rules and special calls, which varied by town and even by family.</p>

  <h2>Local variations</h2>
  <p>As Whot spread, local players introduced special numbers for “pick” actions, suspension and so on. The WHOT (20) card was often used as a “wild” to demand shapes or numbers, a mechanic that remains central. Many players still remember specific calls or rituals that differ by region.</p>

  <h2>Naija Whot: preserving the play</h2>
  <p>Naija Whot aims to collect these house rules and offer a standardised rule set online. The goal: preserve the communal feel while offering consistent play for newcomers and veterans.</p>
